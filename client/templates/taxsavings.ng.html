				<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
					<p><b>One size doesn't fit all.</b></p>
						<p>Individuals have varying risk tolerance and the risk taking capability. An investor’s risk tolerance is a mix of his/her ability and the willingness to take risk. Your life circumstances – income, assets, age, education, dependents, financial goals – determine your ability to take risk. Your level of comfort with fluctuations in the value of your investments defines your willingness to take risks.</p>
					<p>Risk taking ability changes with whether you are saving for your retirement (long term) or your marriage (short term).</p>
				</div><!-- col-md-5 -->
				
				<div class="col-md-5">
					<p>If you are a person who enjoys taking risks in general and think of risks as opportunities, your willingness to take risk is high. If you are the one who loses sleep over fluctuations in the value of your investments, you probably don’t like to take risks.</p>
					<p>Any investment advice, like clothing, has to be tailored to fit the individual. Tax saving investments are no different. While one objective is to maximise tax savings, it doesn’t end here. The other aim should be to make investments best suited to your needs.</p>
